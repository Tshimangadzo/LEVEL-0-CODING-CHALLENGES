Convert this pseudocode into actual code. Make it run. Make sure you understand the results. This is a fundamental lesson. If you donâ€™t understand the results then spend some time Googling BODMAS.

x = 1 + 1 * 2
y = (1 + 1) * 2
z = 1 + ( 1 * 2 )
a = 1 + 1 * 2 / 2
b = (1 + 1 * 2 ) /  2

print all the things
