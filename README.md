Task 0.1

Convert this pseudocode into actual code. Make it run. Make sure you understand the results. This is a fundamental lesson:

x = 0
y = 1
Print the value of x
Print the value of y
x = x + 3
y = y + x
Print the value of x
Print the value of y

Task 0.2

Convert this pseudocode into actual code. Make it run. Make sure you understand the results. This is a fundamental lesson. If you don’t understand the results then spend some time Googling BODMAS.

x = 1 + 1 * 2
y = (1 + 1) * 2
z = 1 + ( 1 * 2 )
a = 1 + 1 * 2 / 2
b = (1 + 1 * 2 ) /  2

print all the things

Task 0.3

Write a function named hello, it needs to take in a string as an argument. The function should work like this:

eg: hello("Tshepo") should output

Hello Tshepo!

Task 0.4

Write a function named even_or_odd or evenOrOdd. The name of the function depends on the conventions of the language you are writing in. If you don’t know what name to choose then check the clean code guidelines.

Your function should take an integer and print in the word “even” or “odd”

eg, if the input is 3 then the output is “odd”. If the input is 4 then the output is “even”

Task 0.5

Write a function that takes in three numbers. These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of a triangle.

Task 0.6

Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number.

Do this without using any builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch.

The function should expect a bunch of numbers, not an array or list.

maximum([1,2,3])  // BAD
maximum(1,2,3)  // GOOD
Bonus: How can you change the code so it can take in any number of numbers? Do this without using builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch.

Again, the function should expect a bunch of numbers as input, not an array or list.

Please do not write a whole new function. Upgrade your existing function.

maximum(1,22,3,2)  // this should work

Task 0.7

Write a function that takes in a number representing the temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Write another function that does the opposite (Fahrenheit to Celsius)

Task 0.8

Make a function to convert any number into hours and minutes. (For example, 71 will become “1 hour, 11 minutes; 133 will become “2 hours, 13 minutes.)

Most people get this question wrong. Make sure you handle singulars and plurals for both hours and minutes.

Task 0.9

Write a function that takes in a string and then prints out all the vowels in the string. Make sure it can deal with capital letters and small letters.

For example, Input: "Tshimangadzo", Output: Vowels: i, a, o.

Task 0.10

Make a function that takes two strings as input, and outputs the common characters/letters that they share. (For example, Input: ‘house’, ‘computers’ . Output: ‘Common letters: o, u, e, s’)
